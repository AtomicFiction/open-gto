The GTO library and included programs are provided under the terms of the
GNU Library General Public License (aka LGPL, see COPYING.LESSER) with the
following exceptions (derived from the FLTK LGPL exceptions):

  1. Modifications to the GTO configure script, config header file, and
     makefiles by themselves to support a specific platform do not
     constitute a modified or derivative work.

     The authors do request that such modifications be contributed to
     the GTO project.

  2. Static linking of applications or shared libraries to the GTO
     library does not constitute a derivative work and does not require
     the author to provide source code for the application or library,
     use the shared GTO libraries, or link their applications or shared
     library against a user-supplied version of GTO.

     If you link the application or shared library to a modified
     version of GTO , then the changes to GTO must be provided under
     the terms of the LGPL in sections 1, 2, and 4.

  3. You do not have to provide a copy of the GTO license with programs
     that are linked to the GTO library, nor do you have to identify
     the GTO license in your program or documentation as required by
     section 6 of the LGPL.

     However, programs must still identify their use of GTO. The
     following example statement can be included in user documentation
     to satisfy this requirement:

     [program/shared library] is based in part on the work of the GTO
     project.
