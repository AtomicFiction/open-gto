* Version 3.2

      o Added RiGtoPlugin and RiGtoRibOut to the distribution.  RiGtoPlugin
      should work with most Renderman®-compliant renderers that support the 
      RiProcedural DynamicLoad RIB token.  The plugin will read geometry from
      a gto file and hand it directly to the renderer, eliminating the 
      expensive translation to/from ASCII RIB.  For those that don't support
      DynamicLoad, you may be able to use RiProcedural RunProgram with 
      RiGtoRibOut.  See the documentation for more details.

      o I added an "html" target in the ./doc directory.  It isn't built by
      default, but just type "make html" in there if you want html docs.

* Version 3.1

      o Added the ability to access random objects in a gto file from the
        Python module.

* Version 3.0

      o Included gtoContainer.py (self-documenting module) plus usage examples 
        in python/gtoContainer.

      o configure script now works with Maya 4.x and Maya 5.x
      
      o An interpretation string has been added to the property header.

      o An additional uint32 has been added as padding to the object,
        component, and property headers for future expansion slop.

      o A section on interpretation strings has been added to the documentation
        and to the reader/writer classes.

      o Added a type reference to the documentation.

* Version 2.1

      o gtofilter was changed to optionaly accept POSIX style regular
        expressions in addition to shell-like "glob" expressions.

      o The C++ writer class now defaults to writing compressed files when the
        open() function is called. A second bool argument can be passed to it to
        prevent the compression.

      o The proposed texture assignment protocol (from version 2.0.4) has been
        rejected.

      o A new protocol "channel" is introduced for assigning mapped surface
        varying data on geometry. An arbitrary number of texture maps may be 
        assigned to the geometry. See section 6.13 Channels Protocol.

      o The material protocol has been fleshed out. See section 6.8 Material
        Protocol.

      o The polygon protocol was missing the definition of the optional
        mappings component. See section 6.5 Polygon Protocol.

* Version 2.0.5 Bug fix version. Repaired problems with the configuration
  scripts. Missing headers.

* Version 2.0.4 Bug fix version. Some configuration problems solved.

* Version 2.0 File headers changed. The format is not compatible with 1.0.

* Version 1.0
