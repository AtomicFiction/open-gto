	* Added support for RiCurves.

	* Added m_reader member variable to RiGtoObject, so we can use
	stringFromId(), etc. if needed.

2004-01-27  Mike Root  <mike@tweakfilms.com>

	* Made default number of instances 1 instead of 0 so things without
	  globalMatrix properties actually render

2003-06-14  Mike Root  <mike@tweakfilms.com>

	* Added the RiGtoOnOffList class, which GREATLY increases the parsing 
	speed of long On/Off lists.

2003-05-12  Mike Root  <mike@tweakfilms.com>

	* Fixed bug where Pref was not being handed to Entropy if there was
	no difference file (i.e. ref=open=closed).

2003-04-28  Mike Root  <mike@tweakfilms.com>

	* Changed error messages for mismatching position/normal counts in ref
	and open/close files to include offending object name.

2003-04-01  Mike Root  <mike@tweakfilms.com>

	* Began ChangeLog

	* Added the ability to read normals on poly objects if they exist.  Normals
	can be reference-only or animated in the open/close gto files.

	* Fixed a memory leak with STs
    
	* Changed a few formerly fatal exceptions resulting from missing files
	or malformed geometry to be less severe.  An error message is printed
	and the geometry is not rendered, but processing will continue at the
	next object.
